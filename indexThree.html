                Deep learning is an aspect of artificial intelligence (AI) that is concerned with emulating the
                learning approach that human beings use to gain certain types of knowledge. At its simplest, deep
                learning can be thought of as a way to automate predictive analytics.

                    In a word, accuracy. Deep learning achieves recognition accuracy at higher levels than ever before.
                    This helps consumer electronics meet user expectations, and it is crucial for safety-critical
                    applications like driverless cars. Recent advances in deep learning have improved to the point where
                    deep learning outperforms humans in some tasks like classifying objects in images.

                <p>
                    Most deep learning methods use neural network architectures, which is why deep learning models are often referred
                    to as deep neural networks.The term “deep” usually refers to the number of hidden layers in the neural network.
                    Traditional neural networks only contain 2-3 hidden layers, while deep networks can have as many as 150.
                    Deep learning models are trained by using large sets of labeled data and neural network architectures that learn
                    features directly from the data without the need for manual feature extraction.

                <p>
                    Machine learning offers a variety of techniques and models you can choose based on your application,
                    the size of data you're processing, and the type of problem you want to solve. A successful deep learning
                    application requires a very large amount of data (thousands of images) to train the model, as well as GPUs,
                    or graphics processing units, to rapidly process your data.
